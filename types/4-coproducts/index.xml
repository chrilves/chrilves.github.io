    <title>Episode 4 - CoProducts :: @chrilves&#39; Archives</title>
    <link>https://chrilves.github.io/types/4-coproducts/index.html</link>
    <description>CoProducts, often called sum types, discriminated unions or disjoint unions, are a convenient way to express an alternative between different types. The coproduct of n types (with n being 0, 1, 2, etc) A_1, A_2, …, A_n is precisely the type whose values are (i, a_i) where i is a number, called the tag, between 1 and n both included (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and a_i is a value of type A_i (the actual type then depends on the value of i). Is is often written Either[A_1, ..., A_n] in programming and A_1 + ... + A_n in Type Theory.</description>
