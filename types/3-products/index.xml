    <description>Products, often called tuples, records or case classes, are a convenient way to bundle values of different types into a single value. The product of n types (with n being 0, 1, 2, etc) A_1, A_2, …, A_n is precisely the type whose values are formed with exactly one value of each type A_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It is written (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) in many languages, Product_n[A_1, A_2, ..., A_n] in Scala and A_1 × ... × A_n in Type Theory. As an example, the product of two types A and B would be defined as</description>
